Dev Week 2016 Hackathon Redis Challenge

This app uses the twitter API to get tweets. Then, using Cortana analytics the tweets are analyzed and separated into happy tweets and sad tweets.

Then, these tweets and tag is uploaded into Redis.

And then we can pull from Redis and show the happy and sad tweets.
